# JiggleSoft's Atari 2600

## Memory Card USB Interface - Hardware, Firmware, and Software.


### Introduction

This repository contains the design and implementation details of a USB interface and software management tool for Atari 2600/7800 memory cards, namely the SaveKey and SaveKey+.

The aim of this project is to provide the cheapest and simplest complete management solution for Atari 2600/7800 memory cards (SaveKey) devices.
